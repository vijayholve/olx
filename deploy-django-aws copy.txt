1. SSH into Your EC2 Instance
To begin, connect to your EC2 instance using SSH:
2. Update Your Project Repository
Navigate to your project directory and pull the latest updates from your Git repository.

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ~/myproject
git pull origin main  # or the appropriate branch
3. Upgrade Dependencies (Optional)
If you’ve updated your project’s requirements.txt or need to upgrade your dependencies, activate your virtual environment and upgrade the packages.

Activate Virtual Environment:
bash
Copy
Edit
source venv/bin/activate
Upgrade Dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
If you need to install a specific package version, you can do so with:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install <package-name>==<version-number>
4. Apply New Migrations
If your project includes new database migrations, apply them to your database:

bash
Copy
Edit
python manage.py migrate
5. Collect Static Files
After updating or adding new static files (e.g., CSS, JS, images), collect them to the static directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
6. Restart Gunicorn
To ensure your project is running the latest code, restart Gunicorn.

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl restart gunicorn
7. Restart Nginx
If your project includes changes that require Nginx to reload (like new static files or media files), restart Nginx:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl restart nginx
8. Test the Application
Once you’ve completed all the steps, open your browser and test the application to ensure that everything works as expected.

Visit your domain or public IP address:

bash
Copy
Edit
http://yourdomain.com  # or your EC2 public IP address
Ensure the updated changes are live and functioning properly.

9. (Optional) Clear Cached Files
If you have any cached files or sessions, it’s a good idea to clear them for a fresh start:

bash
Copy
Edit
python manage.py clear_cache
(You may need to implement a custom clear_cache command if required.)

10. Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, here are some common steps to troubleshoot:

Check Gunicorn Logs:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo journalctl -u gunicorn
Check Nginx Logs:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
Check Django Logs:

Review the Django logs for any specific errors related to the upgrade.
